# To do application

---

Create a single user to-do list application deployed on local linux machine which is accessible across IIT Kharagpur's local area network

Basic functionality

- single page application with reasonably good frontend
- Show all the daily To-do items in the home page in a user friendly manner.
- items should be ordered by priority and time as given by the user.
- Also allow the user to create, remove, edit the items on the list
- deploy the website on the local area network

Extra possibilities
- Add user authentication so that only the user can see the to do list
- containerize the application and deploy on render using the docker image
- make the application multi-user complete with user authentication.
